Description:
    Creates the minimum requirements for a components system.

    You will need to do the following manually:

    1. Define component types by creating their required models, form field partials, database tables, and adding relevant additions to the Component model
    2. Add the Componentable concern to relevant models
    3. Update admin forms to support adding multiple components with the f.has_many formbuilder helper
    4. Render the app/views/admin/shared/_components_table.html.erb partial on relevant admin inspect views
    5. Add :components to the collection prioritizable items in config/routes.rb


Example:
    rails generate shortline:components

    This will create:
        app/models/component.rb
        app/models/concerns/componentable.rb
        app/controllers/admin/components_controller.rb
        app/views/admin/components/_form.html.erb
        app/views/admin/shared/_components_table.html.erb
        app/views/shared/_components.html.erb

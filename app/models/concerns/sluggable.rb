# Sluggable
# Enforce a valid URL slug, and build nice URLs
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This concern requires that you create a text field on your model such that
#
#   add_column :people, :slug, :text, null:false, index:true
#
# Afterward, the model will enforce that:
#
#   1. The slug is at least 3 characters
#   2. The slug begins with a letter
#   3. The slug only contains lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes
#   4. Dashes canâ€™t appear at the end of the slug, or one after each other
#   5. The slug is unique
#
# You need to enforce maximum length as needed, outside of this concern.
# You can also modify this file to include additional reserved words as forbidden slugs.

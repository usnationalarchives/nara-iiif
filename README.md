ðŸ¦„ðŸš¨ **NOTICE:** This is Shortline, Threespotâ€™s Rails base-build. The rest of this README is a template. You should remove this block and use this README as a starting point for your new Rails project. Donâ€™t clone this repository to start a new project! This repository is for making modifications to the base build. Instead, [download this project as an archive][download] to start a new app. Search this README for the string `fixme-app-name` when starting new projects.

### fixme-app-name

This project uses [Shortline](https://github.com/Threespot/shortline), Threespotâ€™s base Rails CMS build. It includes configuration for gems we like, such as [Puma][], [Dalli][], [Amazon S3][], [Seed-fu][], and [Paperclip][], and it's ready to deploy to Heroku.

[Puma]: http://puma.io
[Dalli]: https://github.com/mperham/dalli
[Amazon S3]: http://aws.amazon.com/s3/
[Seed-fu]: https://github.com/mbleigh/seed-fu
[Paperclip]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip

### Getting Started with Node

- [Installing a Version of Node](doc/getting-started.md#installing-a-version-of-node)
- [Installing Yarn](doc/getting-started.md#installing-yarn)

### Working on this Project

Clone this project and change to it. Then attach to the Heroku application.

```shell
git clone -o github git@github.com:Threespot/fixme-app-name.git
cd fixme-app-name
heroku git --ssh-git --app fixme-app-name
```

Pull down a copy of the production database to work on locally:

```shell
dropdb fixme-app-name
heroku pg:pull DATABASE fixme-app-name
```

Now install the dependencies:

```shell
bundle install #ruby
yarn install   #node
```

### Configure the Environment

This codebase does not contain any credentials. Instead, developers and Heroku [store configuration in the environment](http://12factor.net/config). On Heroku, their platform handles environment variables you set via `heroku config`. Locally, you store credentials in a special `.env` file in the project folder.

âœ‹ **IMPORTANT:** Always store configuration in the environment. Never commit code that contains credentials. If you commit code with credentials in it, those credentials are no longer safe to use and must be replaced.

Make your environment file:

```
touch .env
open .env
```

Insert the following lines:


```makefile
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=FIXME
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=FIXME

BUGSNAG_API_KEY=FIXME

DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/FIXME-app-name

EXPECTED_HOSTNAME=http://0.0.0.0
EXCEPTION_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS=FIXME

GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_UA=FIXME
GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER=FIXME

MAILGUN_API_KEY=FIXME
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=FIXME
MAILGUN_PUBLIC_KEY=FIXME
MAILGUN_SMTP_LOGIN=FIXME
MAILGUN_SMTP_PASSWORD=FIXME
MAILGUN_SMTP_PORT=587
MAILGUN_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.mailgun.org

PORT=8080

RAILS_ENV=development
RACK_ENV=development

S3_BUCKET_NAME=FIXME
SECRET_KEY_BASE=FIXME
SERVER_EMAIL_ADDRESS=FIXME
SMTP_LOGIN=FIXME
SMTP_PASSWORD=FIXME
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.mailgun.org

YOUTUBE_PUBLIC_KEY=FIXME

WEB_CONCURRENCY=1
```

The file is in key-value format, with one key per line. When you boot the Rails server, it will look for this file and set the specified environment variables. Each variable is described below.

##### RAILS_ENV and RACK_ENV

These variables cause the Rails app to boot differently depending on the working context.

- They should both be set to `development` in development mode
- They should both be set to `production` on Heroku.

##### DATABASE_URL

This is a Postgres URI to your database. It should be in the form `postgres://localhost/<DATABASE_NAME>`.

If you are not using Postgres.app, you might need to provide a user and password, so the URI will be in the form `postgres://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE_NAME>`.

Heroku sets this value in production for you. Do not change Herokuâ€™s value.

##### WEB_CONCURRENCY

The number of Rails servers to create per Heroku dyno.

- In development this should be `1`. (Just one server for you)
- On Heroku itâ€™s `2` or `3`, depending on how much memory you have available.

##### EXPECTED_HOSTNAME

This should be set to the scheme and domain name that the server will run on.

In development, if you expect to access the application via your network address or IP address, it needs to be set accordingly:

- If you want to use something like `http://csuhta.threespot.com:8080`, set this value to `http://csuhta.threespot.com`
- If you want to use something like `http://0.0.0.0:8080`, set this value to `http://0.0.0.0`

In production, this should be the official URL of the server, ex. `https://www.threespot.com`. Visits to the production URL that are not on this address will be forcibly redirected to it.

This setting does not include the port, see below.

##### PORT

The port for the application to listen on.

- In development, you should pick your favorite userspace port to develop on, like `8080` or `5000`.
- In production, this is set for you by Heroku. Do not change Herokuâ€™s value.

##### SECRET_KEY_BASE

This variable sets the key that Rails uses to sign cookie and sessions. Changing this key after it's set will rotate every cookie and session on the site. It should be a random string of at least 64 characters, or the application may be vulnerable to session hijacking. Generate a good value with `openssl rand -hex 32`

- Heroku sets this for you in production.
- Your development and Heroku key should be **different**.

##### S3_BUCKET_NAME, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

Set `S3_BUCKET_NAME` equal to your Amazon S3 bucket name. (Remember that the bucket name is different for Heroku and each developer.)

Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to your AWS key pair.

##### BUGSNAG_API_KEY

The API key for the Bugsnag project that should receive exceptions thrown by this application.

##### SMTP_LOGIN, SMTP_PASSWORD, SMTP_PORT, and SMTP_SERVER

These are the credentials for the STMP server that Rails uses to send email.

### What else goes in the environment?

Any password, key, or username needed for your app to connect to external services. Make the key names match their associated documentation and don't be afraid to make them long. Some other examples of good key names include: `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`, `TWITTER_OAUTH_SECRET`

### Booting the App

If your dependencies are installed and the environment is A-OK, you should be able to start the Rails server and Webpack dev server with:

```shell
bin/server
```
